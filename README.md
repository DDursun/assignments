# Repository for machine learning projects 


This repository contains some of my  Machine Learning and Data Science related assignments and mini-projects representing my learning path. Although they were not extensive enough to deserve a separate repository, they deserve a look since they contain key theoretical concepts and practical implementations. The projects showcase fundamental algorithms, EDA, optimization, and workflows for regression and classification tasks, reflecting my learning journey.
